6. Add a quick reflection(2 sentences) about what was difficult __Place on Readme__

The difficult part in the cookie sim is that at first I had a little struggle to code the number of clicks by adding 1. Another diffculty I had while making the Cookie Sim is I didn't find a way to go to a copyright free program as they were all blocked.
